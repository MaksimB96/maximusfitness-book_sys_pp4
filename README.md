## Design

### Design Choices
The website was developed in such a way that had a minimal and colourful approach that is not too much to overload the senses. It has all relevaant information on the home page that allows users to jump directly to the relevant points of interest.

### Colour
Color Choices contain a slightly colder shade of greens and neutral greys and white to compliment all elements. A less satturated green was used as many associate the higher saturated colors with 'vegan'. Highlight color of oraange was used as it plays well with the secondary colors.
<br>

![Color Scheme](docs/features/colors.png)


### Fonts
Solway with a serif fall back was used as the main head text as it provides a nice playful and approachable flair to the website
<br>
Roboto with sans-serif fall back was used as it compliments solway and contrasts to its playful style without being out of place. It is also clear and concise.

### Structure
The Structure of the website is a clean and minimal approach as the main focus of the website is the quiz. Therefore the index page allows for ease of access to all relevant info. The nav bar is clean and simple with all elements being clear and intuative.

<br>

The website is made up of 3 pages:

    -The home page that draws a user and links directly to other points of interest. 
    -The fitness quiz page that contains the quiz script.
    -A contact page that allows easy contact, validation.

## Validation

### HTML Validation
W3C mark-up was utilised in order to validate html of the website. All Pages pass with no errors. Warnings are related to various segments not using Headings, but utilise div elements.

### Accessability
Wave WebAIM was utilized in order to make sure the website met high accessability standards. All pages pass with no errors or contrast errors. Warnings are due to things such as logo having the same link as the hom, which is an intentional feature. The form segment states the labels are not owned by input eventhough they have been propeerly attributed.

2. I then selected the pages link on the left side.
3. I then selected source for the branch prompt.
4. Roughly, 2 minutes after refreshing I recieved a link to my site: https://maksimb96.github.io/LoveBody/
